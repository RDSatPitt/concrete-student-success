Or does it reinforce inequities that already exist?*\\n\\n\"\n\"Approaching this task ethically means weighing three principles: **1.Beneficence** (are we creating positive outcomes?), \"\n\"**2.Proportionality** (do the benefits of including a variable outweigh the risks?), and **3.Transparency** (can we explain and defend our choices to those affected?). \"\n\"If these principles are ignored, models can harm rather than help.

Over the past five years the first-to-second-year retention rate has drifted downward, and graduation timelines have lengthened. Senior leadership has asked the Office of the Provost to treat student persistence as a strategic priority rather than a routine metric. An internal mandate now calls for data-informed, proactive outreach so that support staff can offer help long before a student considers leaving. Within the Office of the Provost a small Student Success Analytics group has been established. This team combines institutional researchers, academic advisors, compliance officers, and data engineers. Its first assignment is to create an early warning intelligence tool that flags continuing undergraduates who appear at risk of stopping out or falling behind schedule. Advisors will then contact those students and connect them with tutoring, financial counseling, or mentoring. The analytics group is expected to respect privacy regulations such as FERPA and recent federal guidance that limits the use of individual financial-aid records in automated decision systems. It is also expected to uphold the university commitment to equity and transparency in every technical choice.</span></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><span class=\"paragraph\">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><h2 id=\"role\">Role</h2></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><span class=\"paragraph\">You serve as the team\u2019s data science specialist. Your immediate task is not to build a model but to decide which pieces of information should be fed into one. Working with colleagues you have assembled a data dictionary drawn from the university warehouse. The dictionary lists common attributes such as high school grade point averages, standardized test scores, race, gender, residency status, and course loads. It also contains financial indicators like Pell eligibility and Expected Family Contribution. Several context-specific items are included as well.Examples are whether a student applied to a regional campus after a main-campus denial, whether a student is a varsity athlete,and the distance between the student\u2019s home address and campus. No raw records are available at this stage of the project;only the variable descriptions, their known limitations, and any red-flag notes provided by legal or ethical reviewers.</span></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><span class=\"paragraph\">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><h2 id=\"business-objective-product\">Business Objective &amp; Product</h2></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><span class=\"paragraph\">Academic advisors need a concise, defensible list of candidate predictors that can drive a predictive model without violating regulations or undermining equitable treatment. Your deliverable for this scenario is a Variable Selection Brief. In one page you will designate each variable as included, excluded, or flagged for additional discussion.

After all, the technical side of data science is often framed as an optimization problem: build a model that predicts the outcome as well as possible. But responsible data science asks us to widen our lens. We are not just optimizing equations, we are making decisions that affect people\u2019s lives. That means that equity, fairness, and transparency must be treated as core design criteria, not afterthoughts.</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Equity in data science means recognizing that different groups do not enter the system with the same resources, exposure, or opportunities. Some variables, such as legacy status or residency, may carry predictive information, but they also risk reproducing structural advantages and disadvantages if included without careful thought. Responsible practice demands that we ask: <em>Does including this variable help us intervene in a way that is genuinely beneficial? Or does it reinforce inequities that already exist?</em></span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Approaching this task ethically means weighing three principles: <strong>1.Beneficence</strong> (are we creating positive outcomes?), <strong>2.Proportionality</strong> (do the benefits of including a variable outweigh the risks?), and <strong>3.Transparency</strong> (can we explain and defend our choices to those affected?). If these principles are ignored, models can harm rather than help. Students might be unfairly flagged as 'at risk' based on noisy or ethically fraught signals; scarce resources could be misallocated; or entire groups might be stereotyped or overlooked. Worse, institutions could erode trust with the very communities they aim to serve.</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">For this reason, your role in Wave 4 is to act as an ethical gatekeeper. You are asked to interpret the potential of each variable not just as a statistician, but as a decision-maker responsible for ensuring that the model you build is both predictive <em>and justifiable</em>. This requires judgment, humility, and the willingness to exclude a variable even when it 'helps' the model, because responsible data science is about more than predictions. It is about trust, fairness, and the long-term legitimacy of data-driven decisions.</span></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><span class=\"paragraph\">&nbsp;</span></span><span class=\"markdown prose dark:prose-invert\"><h2 id=\"learner-reflection\">Learner Reflection</h2></span><div style='width:100%;'><marimo-ui-element object-id='vblA-0' random-id='d34a2970-d235-2f2d-3c15-df1561a94782'><marimo-text-area data-initial-value='&quot;&quot;' data-label='&quot;&lt;span class=&#92;&quot;markdown prose dark:prose-invert&#92;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&#92;&quot;paragraph&#92;&quot;&gt;Considering what you just read, please write a short paragraph on how you think a person in your hypothetical position should guide their actions during this process.
